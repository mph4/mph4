### ðŸ‘‹ 

Hi! I'm [@mph4](https://github.com/mph4), GitHub's [Chief Security Officer](https://github.blog/2021-02-24-hello-from-githubs-new-chief-security-officer/) and SVP of Engineering. Prior to joining GitHub, I was the CISO at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com). I joined Cisco in 2018 when they acquired [Duo Security](https://www.duo.com), where I was the Vice President of Security. Earlier in my career, I had the privilege of working as a Sr. Member of the Technical Staff at [CERT/CC](https://cert.org).
